# ⏱️ 4-bit Synchronous Counter

## 📘 Introduction
A **4-bit Synchronous Counter** is a counter where **all flip-flops are triggered simultaneously** by the same clock signal.  
Unlike asynchronous (ripple) counters, synchronous counters eliminate the propagation delay because all bits change state together.
